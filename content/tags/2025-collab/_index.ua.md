title: "2025 Art Collab: Life of Learning"
---

The works below are a selection of illustrations created for the 2025 Solarpunk Art Collab ran by the Story Seed Library and [Andrewism](https://www.youtube.com/@Andrewism/).

> Welcome to the 2025 edition of the collaborative solarpunk art project! This year’s theme is Life of Learning, focusing on education, teaching, mentorship and research in a better climate future!
>
> The goal of the project is to welcome everyone to collaborate together, share ideas and get inspired by each others’ works! This is not a contest - there are no prizes and no winners, outside of everything we learn from each other and the visions of a better world we create!

You can read more about the initiative at its [event page](/pages/andrewisms-art-collab-2025/). All of the works are available on [Andrewism's tumblr](https://andrew-ism.tumblr.com/post/788704934138937344/solarpunk-art-2025-life-of-learning).
