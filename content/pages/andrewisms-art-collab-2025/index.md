Welcome to the 2025 edition of the collaborative solarpunk art project! This year's theme is **Life of Learning**, focusing on education, teaching, mentorship and research in a better climate future!

The goal of the project is to welcome everyone to collaborate together, share ideas and get inspired by each others' works! This is not a contest - there are no prizes and no winners, outside of everything we learn from each other and the visions of a better world we create!

## Theme Guidelines

- Artwork must depict people engaged in teaching and learning: literature, sciences, arts, trades, sports, crafts, cooking, husbandry, permaculture, social skills, and more.
  - Consider settings within and outside the classroom or lecture hall. How do mentorships and apprenticeships look lke? Does practical learning happen in libraries, makerspaces and hackerspaces?
  - Imagine how humanity, nature, and technology interact in your setting - and how it's different from today. 
  - Think how different age groups interact in a setting where lifelong learning is the norm, not only in schools!
  - Explore the role of research, non-exploitative peer review, and science education.
  - How does [Citizen Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) look like, when regular people care for and monitor the ecosystems around them?
  - Take a look at the [Story Seeds](/seeds/) and see if any of them inspires you!
- Artwork must reflect some degree of human diversity. People of different racial and cultural backgrounds, genders and sexualities, abilities, ages, etc, should be included. Solarpunk is for the people. All the people.
- Artwork may depict urban, semi-urban, and rural spaces, including interiors or exteriors.
- Greenwashing is not solarpunk. Don't just change a single element about our current world, like adding trees or stained glass to unsustainable buildings. Think about subtler and more beautiful consequences of sustainability - like how making technology repairable can make everything more long-lasting and personalized.
- Artwork should be a realistic vision of near-future, with no fantasy or far-future elements. We want to explore how humanity can change, not what magical technology can save us.
- Please indicate in your submission what form(s) of education you are reimagining in your work. Try to venture outside the typical.
- Further theme guidelines may be included as artist discussion ensues/clarifying questions are asked.
