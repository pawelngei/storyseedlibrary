## For Artists

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Library!

We want to feature art which:

- Shows a visions of a better world acknowledging Climate Change
- Is set in a near-future with no "magical" technologies, whether powered by nanorobots or dragon blood
- Features humans, communities and civilization living in balance with the ecosystems - not just the wilderness and ruins.

We do not accept AI art or art created with the use of AI (even if it's just a texture).

If you'd like to submit your art to the Library, please {{< cloakemail display="contact me" address="storyseedlibrary@alxd.org" >}} with:

- The title of your work
- The description of your work
- A high resolution version of the image
- A specific license chosen ([license picker](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) and [overview](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/))
- Link to your own page / gallery where you confirm the license of your work

If it's your first time, please also provide:

- Your name / pseudonym / how you'd like to be credited as
- A one-line description of yourself, maybe with pronouns and country / languages
- A list of links you'd like us to display, including your page, socials, patron / payment portals

You can [glaze](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html) your work with some AI poison if you choose, but it's not a requirement (or a recommendation). I strongly believe that the best way to challenge AI art is to create intentional works with symbols AI is not - and will not be - capable of. If we fight on its rules, computational power against computational power, we will eventually lose.
