If you haven't used Creative Commons licenses before, please check out their [handy guide](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) to different licenses.

Depending on what is the character of your project, you can use the following ones:

## Commercial Project

You can use [CC BY 4.0](/tags/cc-by-4.0/) art just by crediting the artist. You don't need to notify them about your use, but it's considered polite to do so.

[CC0](/tags/cc0) works are considered public domain - you don't even need to credit the author, but if one is known - we encourage you to do so!

If you don't modify the work (for example by making it a part of a collage), you can also use the [CC BY-ND 4.0](/tags/cc-by-nd-4.0/) license! You can read more about what is a modification / adaptation / remix [here](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/bothell/creativecommons/adapt).

If you do modify the artwork, you can also use [CC BY-SA 4.0](/tags/cc-by-sa-4.0/), but you need to release your remix under the same license. Feel free to reach out to us - maybe we'll host it on the Library page as well!

## Non-commercial Project

If your project is non-commercial, you can freely use [CC BY 4.0](/tags/cc-by-4.0/) and [CC BY-NC 4.0](/tags/cc-by-nc-4.0/) as well!

[CC BY-ND 4.0](/tags/cc-by-nd-4.0/) and [CC BY-SA 4.0](/tags/cc-by-sa-4.0/) work the same way as described above, but you can also use their non-commercial versions, [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](/tags/cc-by-nc-nd-4.0/) and [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](/tags/cc-by-nc-sa-4.0/). We also have some art released under the previous version of the license, [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](/tags/cc-by-nc-nd-3.0/)!

## Best Practices Crediting Artists

You've chosen the art you want to use, now what?

Creative Commons Wiki has a good article on the [recommended practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution):

> Whenever you are reusing CC licensed works, we recommend that the attribution include the Title, Author, Source, and License. This is true whether you’re sharing the work as-is or if you have made an adaptation. To remember these attribution elements, it’s helpful to think of the acronym: TASL.

> Title: What is the name of the work?
>
> Author: Who allows you to use the work?
>
> Source: Where can people find the work?
>
> License: How can you use the work?

There's also a good section on [how to attribute adaptations](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Recommended_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_great_attribution_for_when_you_have_created_an_adaptation).
