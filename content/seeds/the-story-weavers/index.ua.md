> A community of writers, dreaming of a better future, struggling to find words to express the hope they so desperately need. They feel like children lost in thick fog, calling to each other, so happy when they find someone who shares their vision - and with each new one, the fog is getting thinner and more people can see them. Some day, they will all see the sun.
