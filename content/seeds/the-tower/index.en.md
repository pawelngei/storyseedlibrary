> A community is freshly moved into a new, wooden, sustainable, climate-controlled tower designed to help them be close to each other and live communally. For some it is a dream come true, for others it is a culture shock, but everyone is struggling with the trauma of losing their old homes to floods, fires and relocation programs.
