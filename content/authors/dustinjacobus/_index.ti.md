Dustin Jacobus is an illustrator and industrial design engineer whose work explores how nature and the built environment can grow together. Deeply inspired by natural systems, his art is rooted in biomimicry, sustainable design, and the solarpunk movement. He envisions a world where we coexist in harmony with all life forms, creating sustainable, water-rich, and green environments, both urban and beyond and expresses these ideas through his art. His vision has been shared in exhibitions, talks, workshops, and a wide range of publications across books, magazines, and other media.
