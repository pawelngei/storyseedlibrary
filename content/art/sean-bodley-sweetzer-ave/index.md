I hope you enjoy this attempt to turn my concrete Los Angeles neighborhood into a live-in garden. 

The goal of this assignment was to envision a Carbon Negative apartment building, based on the strategies laid out in the book [Visualizing Climate Change by Stephan Sheppard](https://www.routledge.com/Visualizing-Climate-Change-A-Guide-to-Visual-Communication-of-Climate/Sheppard/p/book/9781844078202?fbclid=IwAR1rm7HSaBGlMT8UXfysBTTKcv1y_s35cli93K2XMWkyw6dPo_WX-nIlHzM). Here is the [previous post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/36468066) highlighting my sources if you're curious.

There were so many aspects to tackle, I'm pretty exhausted from this illustration. There were a lot of challenges but your support helped me finish. 

Once get some rest I really hope to do more of these, and would love to see designs of your neighborhood!
