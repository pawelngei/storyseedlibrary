On the left is a plein air painting of evening traffic as viewed from the Morrissey Blvd overpass. On the right is a speculative repaint of our future society. Shown is the Hwy 1 High Speed Rail at the center divider beside a transfer station to the prolific local bus line. A line of native trees divides the road from the rail. Through trial and error the community has settled on a permit system allowing only occupational trucks to use the roads with the busses.  Vehicles are adorned with murals by local artists instead of ads.
