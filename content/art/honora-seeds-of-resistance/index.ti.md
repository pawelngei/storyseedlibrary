Inspired by protesters, journalists, academics, and organizers of the climate movement. Millions of activists in the streets, thousands risking and losing their lives to stop extraction in the global South. The ecological transition cannot be stopped from growing, but billions will be invested in delay tactics. This movement will have to be kinder than ever before, it will have to think in systems, protect the seeds of resistance until together we gather the courage to lead an entire civilization beyond extractivism.
