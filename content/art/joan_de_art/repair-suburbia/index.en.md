It took us a few tries to get it right, but we finally rebuilt the world to included everyone. Wheelchairs could enter every room. Suburban communities joined their front lawns together to create swaths of welcoming space for gardens and fish ponds and gathering spaces.

Urban sprawl was curbed, flooding a heartache of the past as we made space for rivers to return. Cities and suburbs were no longer designed around cars, but for us and nature to connect with each other again. Loneliness and social isolation plummeted as we made deliberate spaces to rest and play together in the sun.

Abandoned lots were repaired an rewilded with native woods, community gardens and mico-meadows, the wild bird population sang outside our windows again. They missed us, as much as we missed them.

We can repair our world. It's not too late to change.
