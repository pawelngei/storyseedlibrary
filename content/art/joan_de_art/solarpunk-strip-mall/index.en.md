‘A better world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.’- Arundhati Roy

Are you ready for the beautiful future that is coming? A world where we prioritize communities and connections over cars and capitalism. The hot black asphalt lots that once held our giant polluting vehicles were reclaimed with gardens, playgrounds, patios and parks.

Parking lots became third places where people were able to relax on benches and fountains, chat with neighbors and meet lovers. The sea of parked monochrome cars was banished and became a vibrant eco-social center that was lovingly restored back to the people.
We ensured that a wheelchair user was welcomed everywhere, stairs became smooth ramps for bikes and strollers and deliveries. We added more places to rest and invited our animal friends to return, building a sapphire necklace of ponds and small lakes in shopping centers throughout the suburbs. We watched in delight as frogs and turtles and endangered birds returned. We embraced our place in the ecosystem not as masters, but as respectful friends.
Parking Lots for People.
