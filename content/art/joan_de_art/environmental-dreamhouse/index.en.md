I recently visited an LGBT+ eco-commune and was amazed at how universal design was baked into the infrastructure. Not only were mobile disabilities considered, they were celebrated. Wheelchair ramps were decorated with fairy lights, shared kitchens had lowered appliances, there were beautiful brass handles instead of doorknobs. Rest was encouraged, there were benches and nap nooks galore. ⁠
⁠
They had solar panels and compost bins, rooftop rain filtered through native plants to water their intricate aquaponics garden systems, children rode bikes through mulched neighborhoods. Birdhouses and beehives, chicken coops and shared wheelbarrows. Electric car ports. ⁠
⁠
We can build this world together. Others are already doing it, we can follow them into this bright and beautiful future. Cooperation, compromise, collaboration. ⁠
