The future finally came when we stopped seeing each other as strangers, but as a community made of stardust. It started with imaging a better world, then building towards it. We had once forgotten who we were. We were trapped in a system of isolation, capitalism and cruelty. But we changed because something had to change.

A collective made of frontline responders, visionaries, builders, disruptors, caregivers, experimenters, weavers, storytellers, healers and guides came together to create an ecosystem of mutual care for each other and the planet. Everyone had a role in the transformation, and while it was not a perfect system, we did our best to make sure nobody was left behind, or forgotten.

Land management was returned to the indigenous communities with ancestral knowledge. Land back meant fires and floods no longer destroyed our neighborhoods and wildlife. Buildings were constructed or retrofitted to include all disabilities, wheelchair accessibility became the celebrated standard, not the exception. We removed personal cars from our infrastructure and returned the roads to the people. Children could safely bike and play in the streets again. Public transportation became a safe and adventurous way to connect with neighbors and communities. Animals gained more rights, factory farming became a relic of the past as our food chains became localized and seasonal. Nature healed as we welcomed her back into our daily lives. Grief became a shared load, nobody suffered in silence anymore.

We remembered how magnificent we could be together.

Solidarity instead of silence.
Community instead of capitalism.
Landback instead of landfills.
Solarpunk instead of scarcity.

Join us as we fight hard and love harder for a better world.
