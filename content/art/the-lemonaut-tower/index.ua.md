An illustration to one of the Solarpunk Prompts episodes, [The Tower](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-tower) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Tower)]:

> A community is freshly moved into a new, wooden, sustainable, climate-controlled tower designed to help them be close to each other and live communally. For some it is a dream come true, for others it is a culture shock, but everyone is struggling with the trauma of losing their old homes to floods, fires and relocation programs. While the adults deal with their emotions, children are quick to run around and explore the wonders of their new home.

Based on the [story seed](/seeds/the-tower).

The illustration itself is a collaboration between The Lemonaut (lineart, characters, colors) and Scandinavian101 (architecture, wooden construction research).
