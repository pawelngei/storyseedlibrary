I'm thrilled to share this new artwork in collaboration with [Andrewism](https://www.patreon.com/saintdrew/posts) on his latest video [How to Build a Solarpunk City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UmU1dSe3n0&ab_channel=Andrewism).  

Go give it a watch, he covers many interesting topics and caveats of urban design.  I think you will enjoy this video very much!

I hope you dig the finished painting above and close-ups.
