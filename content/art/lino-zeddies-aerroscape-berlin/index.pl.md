## Angielski opis

This art was a submission to the [RealUtopien](https://realutopien.info/visuals/berlin-friedrichstrasse-utopia-2048/) project.

This image was commissioned for the book cover of "Utopia 2048" by Lino Zeddies to visualize a utopian Berlin. Based on satellite images from Google Earth from 2020, Berlin's Friedrichstrasse was altered accordingly to depict a futuristic city of sustainability, beauty, and vitality. "The city appeared like a symbiosis of high-tech and jungle. Maglev trains roamed between tropical trees. Large shrubs sprouted from impressive steel structures, and climbing plants grew everywhere, covering the facades of the buildings."
