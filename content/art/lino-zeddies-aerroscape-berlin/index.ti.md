This art was a submission to the [RealUtopien](https://realutopien.info/visuals/berlin-friedrichstrasse-utopia-2048/) project.

This image was commissioned for the book cover of "Utopia 2048" by Lino Zeddies to visualize a utopian Berlin. Based on satellite images from Google Earth from 2020, Berlin's Friedrichstrasse was altered accordingly to depict a futuristic city of sustainability, beauty, and vitality. "The city appeared like a symbiosis of high-tech and jungle. Maglev trains roamed between tropical trees. Large shrubs sprouted from impressive steel structures, and climbing plants grew everywhere, covering the facades of the buildings."

Aerroscape, aka Alexander Rommel, works in landscape architecture and urban planning and is a part-time digital painter. Through art, he tries to raise awareness of the importance of respecting nature and the environment.
