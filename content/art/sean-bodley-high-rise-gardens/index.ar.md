For this piece I wanted to explore one of my favorite subjects (vertical farming) within  Parable of the Sower. I imagined a gardener enjoying a breeze with the butterflies from one of the top levels. 

Destruction and decay lie below, but up in the gardens, life is good.

I'm enjoying the creative process of sketching different people and places within the city.  

Next week I will be getting back to concepting real "punks" in this society, with some grungy props and characters, but I wanted to sketch this piece first because it was really peaceful to paint.
