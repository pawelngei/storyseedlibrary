An illustration for two separate Solarpunk Prompts episodes, [The Disabled Community](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-disabled-community) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Disabled-Community)] and [The Hackerspace](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-hackerspace) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Hackerspace)]. Two halves representing the cover arts for each of the episodes connect in the wider version above.

> A community of people with disabilities share their best tricks on how to deal with a harsh world not made for them. A lot of what they share remains unspoken, for every one knows the pain and the challenges they face.

> A hackerspace sits within a city still clinging to their own ways while the rest of the world changes. Activists, technologists, inventors and educators trying to show the communities around them that it’s possible to live differently, while actively squabbling over whose plan is the best.

Based on the story seeds: [the hackerspace](/pl/seeds/the-hackerspace) and [the disabled community](/pl/seeds/the-disabled-community).
