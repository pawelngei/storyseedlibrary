An illustration for two separate Solarpunk Prompts episodes, [The Disabled Community](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-disabled-community) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Disabled-Community)] and [The Hackerspace](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-hackerspace) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Hackerspace)]. Two halves representing the cover arts for each of the episodes connect in the wider version above.

> A community of people with disabilities share their best tricks on how to deal with a harsh world not made for them. A lot of what they share remains unspoken, for every one knows the pain and the challenges they face.

> A hackerspace sits within a city still clinging to their own ways while the rest of the world changes. Activists, technologists, inventors and educators trying to show the communities around them that itâ€™s possible to live differently, while actively squabbling over whose plan is the best.

Based on the story seeds: [the hackerspace](/seeds/the-hackerspace) and [the disabled community](/seeds/the-disabled-community).
