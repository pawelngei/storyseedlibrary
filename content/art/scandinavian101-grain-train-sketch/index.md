A sketch of a sustainable future - a train filled with small containers with food from local farming cooperatives. 

It was used by [alxd](authors/alxd) in his [Lenses and Foundations essay](https://alxd.org/solarpunk-lenses-and-foundations.html) to illustrate how hard it is to explain actual sustainable practices on an infrastructural scale without symbols encoded in the culture.
