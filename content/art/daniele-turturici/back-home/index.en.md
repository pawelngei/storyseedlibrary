Even though I love cyberpunk aesthetic, it’s definitely not the kind of society I’d want to live in. More and more often, when I look at the news, it feels like we’re drifting toward a dystopia no one really wants, yet one that seems inevitable.

But the truth is: nothing is inevitable.

That’s why I’ve found myself increasingly imagining its exact opposite: solarpunk. A world where cities coexist with nature, energy is clean and renewable, and technology serves humanity instead of enslaving it.

I love picturing small moments of everyday life in a world like that. It makes me feel calmer, and a little more hopeful about the future.
