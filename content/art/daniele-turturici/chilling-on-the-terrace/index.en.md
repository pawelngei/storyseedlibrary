Like in almost all my illustrations, even when exploring the Solarpunk genre, what I love most is imagining little everyday life moments like this one. Just people unwinding after a long day, enjoying the evening breeze on their terrace where they grow their own veggie garden.

I love the idea of bringing way more greenery into cities, along with technology that's integrated with nature and produces clean, renewable energy. The cool thing is that a future like this is already totally possible—we just need the will to make it happen.

I hope these illustrations bring you at least a bit of peace and hope for a better future.
