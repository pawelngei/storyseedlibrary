In the heart of a lush orchard, a grandfather shares his knowledge with his granddaughter, showing her how an apple-harvesting robot works.
Perched on the back of a gentle yak, the child listens with wonder, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

This sunlit scene highlights a gentle transmission of knowledge between generations, where nature, technology, and humanity coexist in harmony.
