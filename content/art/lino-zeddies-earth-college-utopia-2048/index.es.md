This art was a submission to the [RealUtopien](https://realutopien.info/visuals/earth-college-utopia-2048/) project.

The image was commissioned for Lino Zeddies' book “Utopia 2048” to depict a utopian university campus, the “Earth College” in the year 2048. Based on satellite images from Google Earth from 2020, the cityscape of Malmö was modified to represent a futuristic university city of sustainability, beauty, and vitality.

Aerroscape, aka Alexander Rommel, works in landscape architecture and urban planning and is a part-time digital painter. Through art, he tries to raise awareness of the importance of respecting nature and the environment.
