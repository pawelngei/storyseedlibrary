> What to do with prisons no longer in use? Some places restructure them to serve a different purpose, others turn them into reminders of the cruelty of the past. This is sort of that. After being wrecked just a smidgeon, the place wasn't maintained, but left to the elements and the reckless - it's now an overgrown relic full of graffiti and murals, and regularly visited by those who aren't scared of decaying stairs and shaky railings. It's a bit controversial among local adults, some arguing it should be cleaned up, others that it's an appropriate bit of risk for the younglings who need a bit of danger to feel alive. Some might still be feeling nostalgic for the times they hung around these moss-covered walls.

> New generations are taught about the historical meaning of the site. As a result, coming there often fills one with a sense of both dread and a desire to unleash, to bring freedom into a space that was built to take it away. Teens aren't known to be very respectful, but the atmosphere and local legends do force at least a slight change of attitude in the visitors.

The illustration is set in a small fictional town of New Spark.
