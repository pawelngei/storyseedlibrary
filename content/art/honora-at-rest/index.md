Hey psst, now that I've got your attention, we need to Stop this fucking line 3 tar sands pipeline from ravaging indigenous lands and our atmosphere: go to https://www.stopline3.org/#intro to learn why it matters, and https://www.stopline3.org/take-action for a petition , or if you're hardcore donate or show up for some NVDA (and no, I don't mean Nvidia).

#StopLine3 Non Violent Direct Action, to save our planet!
