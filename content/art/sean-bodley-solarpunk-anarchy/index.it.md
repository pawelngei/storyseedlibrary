# Descrizione Originale:

One of my heroes Charlie Munger said that "If you don't destroy one of your most closely held ideas each year, then you're not learning enough."

Well, I've learned a lot by listening to Andrew Sage on his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@Andrewism

(FYI We collaborated on a previous piece about [How to Build a Solarpunk City](/it/art/sean-bodley-solarpunk-city/).)

First off, I had a blast creating this vibrant picture with Andrew. I hope you enjoy the close up details and I'll share the process down below :)

But first, Anarchy, or Free Association as he describes in the video that this picture is for,

Without getting too complex, I started asking myself "What would make Free Association/Anarchy really possible"

Since I already believe that:

A. People are inherently collaborative overall

B. Trust is a key part of human nature,

C. Creativity emerges from combinations of freedom and constraints:

With that said, I believe that governments are formed as the path of least resistance to solve all of the problems we face. Most governments aren't created on the spot, they evolve over a long time. There are also many many people who would gladly sacrifice freedom for security.

So thinking on this, I believe that the most free societies will be possible in:

1. A nearly scarcity-free world

2. A rewards based society, very little punishment, very good rewards.

Both of these ideas tie into Solarpunk. I believe humanity's ability to survive climate change is linked to our ability to problem solve creatively and collaboratively, under pressure.

That's it! I don't have any solutions of how to get there, but I really enjoyed thinking about these topics and I've definitely changed my mind on Anarchy more than I expected to.

Thanks again to Andrew for inspiring the work and art directing throughout.
