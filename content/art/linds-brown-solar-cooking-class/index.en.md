For the theme, "Life of Learning”, I wanted to show a solar cooking demonstration held in an urban garden. For this demonstration, people are totally free to come and go as they please, with no age-restrictions. In addition to learning how the solar cooker works, the kids are also learning how to identify herbs—especially really aggressive ones like peppermint that make a fantastic tea and always needs thinning out. :)
