## Original Description

This is my submission for the Atomhawk contest atomhawk.com/solarpunk! The theme was Solarpunk, I just decided to participate because I love this theme and I believe it should be emphasized!

In this story, mankind has abandoned its vast irregular cities and ascended the heavens, taking with it industries and farms, allowing the earth to regenerate the steril soil caused by urban sprawl. The new eco cities and vehicles float above an artificial sea of plasma that makes it look like a boreal ocean that seems to come from fantasy tales.
