Guangchangwu, also known as Square Dance, is a communal dance activity done predominantly by elderly people in urban China, especially elderly women. Dancers would gather at a square in formation and follow one or multiple leaders to a choreographed dance. In this illustration, there is a variety of people participating in Guangchangwu, including people of various ages and people with physical disability. Presumably, there are both long-time practitioners and newcomers in the crowd, so there is a sort of learning that crosses age gaps and abilities happening here. In addition, the background includes a community center with a large signage that reads “cafeteria, fitness, library, barbershop”. The building next to it has signages that say “table tennis” and “tea”. In the foreground, the food truck is getting charged by a community battery. The mural to the left is a blessing said during the year of the lamb that roughly translates to “pleasant sensation in the air”.
