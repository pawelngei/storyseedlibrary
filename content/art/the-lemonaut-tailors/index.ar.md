An illustration to one of the Solarpunk Prompts episodes, [The Tailors](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-tailors) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-tailors)]:

Seeing that theyâ€™re much less traditional than their predecessor, will they be accepted by the community? Which bold statement surprised everybody?

Based on the [story seed](/seeds/the-tailors).
