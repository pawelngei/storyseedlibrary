An illustration to one of the Solarpunk Prompts episodes, [The Community Center](https://podcast.tomasino.org/@SolarpunkPrompts/episodes/the-community-center) [[transcript](https://wiki.tomasino.org/writing/Solarpunk-Prompts---The-Community-Center)]:

> A community center, library, or educational hub, initially set up to help people like coal miners re-specialize and find other jobs, has now became a place for unofficial “pilgrimages” of people striving to find their role in life and learn history from those who lived it.

Based on the [story seed](/seeds/the-community-center).
