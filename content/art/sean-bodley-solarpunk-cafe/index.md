This piece is dedicated to Slava Sakhnenko.

Thank you Slava for requesting a depiction of [these characters living city life in Nittany City](https://www.patreon.com/posts/look-what-i-100-84231823).

Let me know what you think of the painting, I'm debating about creating a time-lapse of the process!

Characters and faces are especially difficult for me, so this painting definitely pushed my limits. I almost gave up half way through because I couldn't figure out faces, but I got them to a good place :)
