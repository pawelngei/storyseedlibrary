**Topic**: 
The Factory

**Description**:
In the solarpunk society there is a factory which doubles as a historic monument, whose story is taught in schools. In Italy the Just Transition, from the bottom up and mutualistic, started there. Abandoned by bosses and politicians after the latest industrial crisis, with the threat of redundancy over their heads, the workers occupied their factory and drew up an alternate industrial plan: out with car parts, in with cargo bikes and solar panels!
And in this postcard from the future of the factory we can see how the workers installed their new state-of-the-art solar panels: they are flexible and can adapt to the organic shapes obtained over a cluster of small wind turbines.
Zero-miles energy, from the Sun and from the wind.

With the help of activists and organizations, the workers gathered the starting capital, set up a cooperative and got on with their plan. Following their example, tens of other factories realized that they too could do without bosses. Work for everyone, social value and a society wholly transformed: together, workers and activists overturned the course of the battle and won a better future for all of us.

This sounds like it's a story from the future, but it is not: the GKN Factory Collective needs your help right now to implement its Just Transition plan. Read the full story and become a member of the cooperative with a contribution at the website www.insorgiamo.org/100x10-000/

Spread the word wherever people of conscience are.
Tomorrow's history is made today: solarpunk is a verb for rising!
