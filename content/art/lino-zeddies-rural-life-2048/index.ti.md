This art was a submission to the [RealUtopien](https://realutopien.info/visuals/landleben-utopia-2048/) project.

The image was commissioned for Lino Zeddies' book “Utopia 2048” to depict utopian rural life in the year 2048. Based on satellite images from Google Earth from 2020, the rural scene was modified to represent a regenerative village, a town of sustainability, beauty, and vitality. The image was sponsored by [Barbara Westphal](http://www.westphal-coaching.de/).

Aerroscape, aka Alexander Rommel, works in landscape architecture and urban planning and is a part-time digital painter. Through art, he tries to raise awareness of the importance of respecting nature and the environment.
