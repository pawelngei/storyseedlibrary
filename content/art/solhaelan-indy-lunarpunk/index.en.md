This piece imagines a near-future (or alternate-present) Indianapolis without light pollution, where the illumination sources are all shifted toward the red end of the spectrum to avoid the disruption of circadian rythyms and chiropteran flight patterns, and where folk dance and sing under the stars and the streetlights, which are made to look like Canada lilies (Lilium canadense).
